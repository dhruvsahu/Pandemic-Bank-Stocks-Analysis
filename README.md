# Pandemic-Bank-Stocks-Analysis

In this project, we will be using the Pandas library in Python to analyze bank stocks. We will use Pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also analyze some techniques for stock returns, and how to analyze a stock portfolio.

We will be using data from the following banks:

- Bank of America
- CitiGroup
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Wells Fargo

We will use the data to explore some financial concepts, such as:

- What was the change in price of the stock over time?
- What was the daily return of the stock on average?
- What was the moving average of various stocks?
- What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
- What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
- How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
- How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
